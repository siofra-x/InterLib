For my final project I would like to create an International Bookstore website, where a user can find books from different countries, available in different languages from different countries, in different currencies (will stick to ~5 most used currencies in the world for comfort and complexities sake). The website will have multiple pages and the user can make an account as well as add books to their favourites/library. I have decided to make this website because I love reading and I am an International Business student at Zuyd Hogeschool, so I wanted to combine my passion with my study in a nice international manner. Since in the future I would like to specialize in Marketing, a focus of mine in this project will also be adding many features to make it pretty and hopefully interactive for the user

Must Include:
Book information
Title
Author
Series name (if applicable)
ISBN number
The blurb of the book
Country of origin
Language availability (will keep it to the most produced and printed in)
Price in different currencies
Multiple website pages, in a cozy pretty design that gives good vibes (gezellig)
About me page (as the creator of the website)

Should Include:
Sign up page
Login page
Information of the user, like where they are from included
Pretty book cover designs

Could Include:
Making a add to favourite/library option for the user
Extra pages linked to information about some book authors
Website links where you can purchase the books available in certain countries (amazon, bol, etc.)
Review option for user to rate books

Wonâ€™t Include:
Personal contact information - other than business contact like LinkedIn
International shipping options (as I am not a store lol)
Biased personal opinions
Political books

UPDATE:
